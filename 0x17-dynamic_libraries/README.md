This directory is made for education

In this lession I will be learning how to make and use dynamic libraries of c
code. I will move a bunch of already existing functions that I wrote into this
directory. I will then make object files from all of the c files then make a
library that will have all of the functions I wrote in it. I will be making a
bash script that will do the same thing and I will also use one of the libraries
I will make in some python code.
