This directory is made for education.

In this lession I will be making various functions that will be using doubly
linked lists. Things I will be doing with them will include: making the list,
adding to the list at beginning, end or at an index, freeing a list, printing a
list, summing all of the data in the list, returning value of a given node
and deleting a given node of the list.
